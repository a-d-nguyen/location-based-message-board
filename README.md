# location-based-message-board

As the name implies, this is a location-based message board application by creating multi-view applications, displaying lists of data in recycler views, location tracking, and using a cloud-hosted database (Firebase). This is part of UC Berkeley's CS 160 User Interface and Development course.

Users are able to see how far away they are from all landmarks, but cannot comment or view comments made at a landmark unless they are within 10 meters of the landmark.

Comments and location are updated in realtime for all users of the applicaito using Firebase's Realtime Database.
